# Accepted Advisories

Security advisories that are knowingly accepted because they cannot currently be
removed (for example, a vulnerable crate pulled only transitively with no
upstream fix available). Each entry here must have a matching ID in the
`[advisories] ignore` list in [`deny.toml`](../../deny.toml) so the audit checks
and this document stay in sync.

**There are currently no accepted advisories.** `cargo audit` and
`cargo deny check advisories` both pass with an empty ignore list.

## Process for accepting a new advisory

1. Confirm the advisory cannot be cleared by `cargo update` or a dependency
   feature/version change.
2. Add the `RUSTSEC-XXXX-XXXX` ID to `[advisories] ignore` in `deny.toml`.
3. Add a row to the table below with the rationale and a review date.

| Advisory | Crate | Severity | Source chain | Rationale | Review date |
|----------|-------|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| _(none)_ | | | | | |
